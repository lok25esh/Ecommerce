--> UNITS
there are two types of units they are absolute and relative 

--> absolute unites are fixed they do not change according to the screen size so browser shows 
a scroll bar which is not a good practice 
pixes are fixed units

--> relative units chage according to the screen size 
% is a relative unit 
but consider a two divs where div 1 is parent div and div2 is child div now if u provide height and width 
to the child it will adjust according to the parent div not according to the screen size 

em And rem relative units
em works according to the parent size 1em = 16px 
rem works according to the root size i.e html size

vw and vh 
workes acccording to browser size it depends on browser not on parent element
